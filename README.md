Pressure Sensor Code with Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) for Arduino

This is my first attempt at an Arduino project, so forgive me if it's simple.

BUILDING INSTRUCTIONS:
The circuit diagram should explain most of it (i.e. what pins on the Arduino to use).

OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
It will automatically calibrate to the force applied to it when it is first turned on (essentially zero-ing it). The pushbutton may be used for a manual calibration.
