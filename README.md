Pressure Sensor Code with Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) for Arduino

This is my first experience with the Arduino. It's a work in progress. At present it only determines when a person is sitting at their computer, but the finished product will be able to put the computer to sleep when the user stands. This is also my first attempt at drawing a circuit diagram, so if there are any corrections that need to be made, please tell me under the Issues section of this repository. Thank you!

ASSEMBLY INSTRUCTIONS:
The circuit diagram explains how to assemble the circuit (i.e. what pins on the Arduino to use).

OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:
It will automatically calibrate to the force applied to it when it is first turned on (essentially zero-ing it). The pushbutton may be used for a manual calibration.
